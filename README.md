# Calculator-PyQt5

It is my first ever experience with the PyQt5 library. To practice my concepts/understanding of this library, I decided to create a simple application in python. I opted for the calculator because it covers almost all basic widgets for a simple application i.e box, grid, line edit, button, form, etc.
